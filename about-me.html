        <p>This box contains my bio</p> -->

        <p class="intro">Hello, I'm Jon. I took an interest in coding because puzzles and problems are engaging in my mind.  Learning front-end development is just the beginning of my journey as I would like to pursue a full-stack career path in the future.</p></span>
        <p class="short-bio">I'm a front-end web developer and a student of the Front End Web Development Career Path Bootcamp at Bloc.  During my free time, I prefer to go rock climbing at a gym or cooking a meal for myself and my significant other. On rainy days I prefer to hole up and play a few video games, watch a movie, or read a book.  My previous occupations have dealt with hospitality, starting with being a waiter and making my way up to being head bartender at Sen Sakana in Midtown, New York.  I enjoy working with people, clients or co-workers, and thrive in team-oriented environments.</p>
