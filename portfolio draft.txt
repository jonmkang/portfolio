Hello, I'm Jon. I'm a front-end web developer and a student of the Front End Web Development Career Path Bootcamp at Bloc.  I took an interest in coding because puzzles and problems are engaging in my mind.  Learning front-end development is just the beginning of my journey as I would like to pursue a full-stack career path in the future.

During my free time, I prefer to go rock climbing at a gym or cooking a meal for myself and my significant other.  on rainy days I prefer to hole up and play a few video games, watch a movie, or read a book.
